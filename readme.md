Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in JavaScript on my codercademy JS course.

The game allows two players, a user and a computer, to choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and then determines the winner based on the rules of the game.

How to Play

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
Run the app using "npm run app"
Modify the param on the playGame('X') funcion;
The computer will randomly select its option.
The winner will be displayed on the console by a console.log using colors (npm install colors)

Game Features
User Input Validation: The game ensures that the user's input is valid (either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors') and handles invalid inputs gracefully.
Random Computer Choice: The computer randomly selects its choice (rock, paper, or scissors) using JavaScript's Math.random() function.
Determining the Winner: The game logic compares the user's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner based on the rules of the game.
Secret Cheat Code: If the user inputs 'bomb', they automatically win the game.
